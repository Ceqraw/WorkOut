            <p>Gymnasium apparatus like barbells, jumping boards, running paths, tennis-balls, cricket fields, and
                fencing areas are used for exercises. In safe weather, outdoor locations are the most conducive to
                health.[2] Gyms were popular in ancient Greece. Their curricula included self-defense, gymnastics
                medica, or physical therapy to help the sick and injured, and for physical fitness and sports, from
                boxing to dancing to skipping rope.[3]

                Gymnasiums also had teachers of wisdom and philosophy. Community gymnastic events were done as part
                of the celebrations during various village festivals. In ancient Greece there was a phrase of
                contempt, "He can neither swim nor write." After a while, however, Olympic athletes began training
                in buildings specifically designed for them.[4] Community sports never became as popular among
                ancient Romans as it had among the ancient Greeks. Gyms were used more as a preparation for military
                service or spectator sports. During the Roman Empire, the gymnastic art was forgotten. In the Dark
                Ages there were sword fighting tournaments and of chivalry; and after gunpowder was invented sword
                fighting began to be replaced by the sport of fencing, as well as schools of dagger fighting and
                wrestling and boxing.[5]

                In the 18th century, Salzmann, a German clergyman, opened a workout area in Thuringia teaching
                bodily exercises, including running and swimming. Clias and Volker established gyms in London, and
                in 1825, Doctor Charles Beck, a German immigrant, established the first gymnasium in the United
                States. It was found that gym pupils lose interest in doing the same exercises, partly because of
                age. Variety in exercises included skating, dancing, and swimming. Some gym activities can be done
                by 6 to 8-year-olds, while age 16 has been considered mature enough for boxing and horseback riding.
